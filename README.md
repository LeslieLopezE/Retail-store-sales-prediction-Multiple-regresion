## Retail store sales prediction using multiple regresion and stepwise regression

In this exercise a multiple regression model to predict in-store sales is created, correlation analysis and analysis of variance are conducted, sales values are predicted, model testing for significance and accuracy is performed to recommend whether to use the model or adjust it, and lastly stepwise regression is performed to assess accurary based on variables included to make a recommendation to select the best model.

A national chain of women‚Äôs clothing stores with locations in the large shopping malls thinks that it can do a better job of planning more renovations and expansions if it understands what variables impact sales. It plans a small pilot study on stores in 25 different mall locations. The data it collects consist of monthly sales, store size (sq. ft), number of linear feet of window display, number of competitors located in mall, size of the mall (sq. ft), and distance to nearest competitor (ft). 


### 1. Finding a multiple regression model for the data.

See Figure 1.1 ‚ÄúParameter Estimates‚Äù Table. We can see the values for each Beta coefficients corresponding to each variable. Therefore, the multiple regression model found for Mall Sales is as follows:
Sales= - 0.6768553*Competitors ‚Äì 0,00090285*Mall_Size + 2.09589*Nearest_Competitor + 0.91937*Size +9.07598*Windows + 1506.80179

### 2. Interpreting the values of the coefficients in the model.

Coefficients for each independent variable represent the size of the effect that each variable has on the dependent variable Sales and the sign of each coefficient represent the direction of this effect. Therefore, negative coefficients decrease the value of sale and positive coefficients increase sales:

‚Ä¢ Mall_size has a minimal effect on Sales with a negative direction with a factor of -0,00090285

‚Ä¢ Competitors has the 2nd lowest effect on Sales also with a negative direction with a factor of - 0.6768553

‚Ä¢ Size has the 3rd lowest effect on Sales and positive direction with a factor of 0.91937

‚Ä¢ Nearest_Competitor has the 2nd highest effect on Sales with a positive direction with a factor of +2.09589

‚Ä¢ Windows has the highest effect on Sales with a positive direction with a factor of +9.07598

‚Ä¢ The intercept is the value that Sales has when all of the independent variables are ZERO

### 3. Testing whether the model as a whole is significant. At the 0.05 level of significance,


As shown in Figure 1.1 ‚ÄúAnalysis of Variance‚Äù table, p value < 0.0001, therefore we can conclude that there is significant association between Sales and the model.

### 4. Using the model to predict monthly sales for each of the stores in the study.

As shown in Figure 1.2 ‚ÄúOutput Statistics‚Äù table, we can see the Predicted Values versus Dependent Variable and Residuals, Student Residuals, Std Error Mean Predict and Cook‚Äôs D value.

### 5. Plotting the residuals versus the actual values. Does the model do a good job of predicting monthly sales? Why or why not?

In Figure 1.1 the ‚ÄúResidual by Regressors for Sales‚Äù Plots do not show any pattern or systematic deviation about the zero line which is desirable outcome for a good fit in the regression model.

### 6. Finding and interpreting the value of ùëÖ-square for this model.

As shown in Figure 1.2 ‚ÄúAnalysis of Variance‚Äù the R-square or coefficient of determination is 0.8349, which represents the proportion of variability in the dependent variable that can be explained by the regression model. Therefore, this model explains the variability in Sales at 83.49%, which is high enough.

### 7. Is this model useful in helping the planners?

This model will help the planners because explains the variability in Sales with an R Square value of 0.8349, which is good enough to predict sales with confidence.

### 8. Testing the individual regression coefficients. At the 0.05 level of significance.

As shown in Figure 1.2 ‚ÄúParameter Estimates‚Äù, variables Nearest_Competitor and Windows have p values greater than 0.05 significance level. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis and conclude that these variables are not significant enough to predict Sales.

### 9. Should any variable be dropped from the model?

‚ÄúWindows‚Äù shoud be because its p value is 0.75, because using the backward elimination model, it has the highest p value considering a 0.05 significance level or 0.10 significance level.
The store planners for the women‚Äôs clothing chain want to find the best model that they can for understanding what store characteristics impact monthly sales.

### 10. Using stepwise regression to find the best model for the data.

See Figure 1.3 to show the results from running the Stepwise Selection method for the following model:
Sales= -71.03060*Competitors +0.00079216*Mall_size+ 1.04482*Size+1769.60574

### 11. Analyzing the model you have identified to determine whether it has any problems.

As seen in figure 1.3 the model with 3 variables has an R Square (determination coefficient) of 0.8155 which is less accurate to predict than the original model with 5 variables.

### 12. Writing a memo reporting findings. Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen model

Dear Manager,
After following the company‚Äôs regular practice to conduct a stepwise selection method to determine the best prediction model based on multiple regression for our 25 Store Sales, I have concluded that the following model includes the variables that are the most significant in predicting sales. However, the accuracy of prediction is lower (0.8155 determination coefficient) than using a model that includes all variables (0.8349 determination coefficient). Therefore, further statistical analysis must be made by using 2 other methods like forward and backward regression to compare models resulting from all 3 methods and select the best model as well .
